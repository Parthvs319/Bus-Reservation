In this project, we will build a Bus Ticket Booking or Seat Reservation app. The app will allow users to:

Search for different bus routes on a specific day they want to travel.
Select the suitable schedule for their journey.
Choose one or more seats based on availability.
Submit their reservation to confirm the booking.
We will also have an Admin interface to manage the application. The Admin will be responsible for:

Adding buses, routes, and schedules.
Managing the overall system and data.
Additionally, we will implement authentication and authorization functionalities for the Admin. This ensures that only authorized users can access certain parts of the system, like adding or modifying buses, routes, and schedules. We will also discuss how to secure our data and protect endpoints to ensure proper access control.
